I want to have a user setting that is passed in as a string the string reprsents
 a list of folders along with some 'meta' data. The folders passed in will be 
used cross platform, but I will convert seperators / and \ for the platfrom I am
 running on.The list of folders will be used to search for all sub folders in 
 them

Indavidual folders will be space deliminated, eg
    foo bar foobar/foo foobar/bar

the '^' befor a foldername will be used to seperate any meta data for the
 next one folder, though it should not be space deliminated. If it where, the 
meta tag would apply to no folder, and the folder you intended to apply it to 
will have no meta data at all.

if your folder name needs to littrally start with '^', with any other meta data
 such as '!nix~^myOddFolder' you can start with the '~' character, this will 
 mean that anything between the initial '~' and the first '^' will taken as 
  part of the folder name
    ~!nix~^win_^myOddFolder => !nix~^win_myOddFolder 

Note that you do not need to worry about escpaing meta data if you never use the
 '^' symbol, or if this parts that look like meta data come after the first '^'.
 eg
    ^does_not_need_escaping
however, in this example, the initial '^' will not be counted as part of the 
folder name. As the anything upto and including the first '^' is removed as meta
data, if you want to start your folder name with a '^' you can simple write '^^'
 there is no need use '~^^'

It is also worth noteing that you can combine meta data with escaping, but you 
should not need to. eg

      you might be   |   but can just  |  to match 
    tempted to write |      write      | the folder
                     |                 |
    !win~nix^/foobar | !win^nix/foobar | nix/foobar

A '!' will indicate an exlusion, the folder and all sub folders will not be 
searched, eg
    foobar !^foobar/foo foobar/bar
This will search foobar, and foorbar/bar (it did not need to be expliciatley 
stated) but it will not search foobar/foo.

A tag can be applied to only certain platforms by using a 'code', either 'win', 
'nix' or 'osx'
  'win' => Windows
  'nix' => Linux and Unix like OS
  'osx' => macs/osx 
Only one platform tag can be used, and the last one used will be the one that is
 taken. These can also be combined with '!' (so if you want a folder on two 
platforms, simply exclude it from the third), eg
    !win^foobar/not_windows winosx^only_used_on_osx !winosx^not_osx

In order to do 32/64 bit only folders, you can also use two tags
    'x86' => 32 bit platforms
    'x64' => 64 bit platforms
like OS specific tags, these only one can be ineffect, and the last one used 
takes preccedence. They can be combined along with the OS tags. eg
    x64^all_OSs/only_64_bit !x86win^not_32_bit_nor_Windows

As you can see in this last exxample, the negation works applies to all the tags
. The 'x86win' part says 'if on 32 bit Windows...' and the '!' says do not 
search in this folder. If you wanted Windows AND not 32 but, you should say
'x64win'

As a final point, it is important to consider how the pattern will be 
interpreted. When it is passed, it will be reduced to two lists, one for folders
 to search and one for folders to exlucde from searching. As the string is 
passed, any details that relate to other platforms are droped, leaving only the 
folders that are intended for this platform. Each folder that is include in the 
'include' set will be searched for independently, and each sub folder will be 
cheacked for in the 'exclude' set. If a subfolder is in this 'exclude' set, it 
will not be entered by the search functions. 

For example, if you need to have platform specific code, and you kept it 
contained to a folder structure such as

/src
  /generic_code <- the rest of your projects code
  /platform <- contains just the four sub-folders
    /common <- contains api and wrapper code
    /windows
    /linux
    /osx

you could use a folder search string such as  'src !^src/platform 
src/platform/common win^src/platform/windows nix^src/platform/linux 
osx^src/platform/osx' or 'src/generic_code src/platform/common 
win^src/platform/windows nix^src/platform/linux osx^src/platform/osx'
